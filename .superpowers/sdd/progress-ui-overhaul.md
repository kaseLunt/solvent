# UI Overhaul program ledger

Program spec: docs/specs/2026-08-09-ui-overhaul-program-design.md

## Phase 0 — trust fixes

### p0-1 address-bound stress results (LabClient)
- New pins: tests/unit/address-binding.spec.ts (6), p0-fixes.spec.ts p0-1 (2 e2e).
- Retired pins: none.
- Mutants: comparison-deletion in addressBinding — killed at lab-stale-result
  visibility (e2e) and at the stale-arm equality (unit), each in isolation.

### p0-2 outcome-aware matrix cells (matrixCells + LabMatrix)
- New pins: tests/unit/matrix-outcome.spec.ts (5), p0-fixes.spec.ts p0-2 (2 e2e).
- Updated pins: none (old→new: none). Step 1 found one sub-line pin —
  lab.spec.ts:269 `net eligible accounts +1` (plus `batch #1` at :270) — and the
  render keeps the `net eligible accounts …` fragment FIRST, so both survive
  verbatim; lab.spec.ts, tornado.spec.ts and the r9–r14 fixes specs all pass
  unchanged.
- Retired pins: none.
- Known duplication, flagged for Phase 3 cleanup: when `newly_eligible_accounts`
  ≠ 0 the sub-line states the count twice — the pinned legacy
  `net eligible accounts +N` fragment AND `cellPrimaryOutcome`'s
  `+N newly eligible` part. When Phase 3 touches the matrix, drop the legacy
  fragment and move lab.spec.ts:269's pin onto the composed part.
- Helper relocation: `usd` moved LabMatrix.tsx → matrixCells.ts (it was
  module-private to the component; the pure composition must print the same
  dollars). `find_referencing_symbols` after the move: only `cellPrimaryOutcome`
  and LabMatrix's two call sites reference it — no other consumer.
- Fixture variants (both `structuredClone` of the committed
  run-book.eth_minus_30.json, one documented purpose each):
  1. surfacing variant — engines[0].bad_debt_delta_usd → "15900";
     engines[0].market_realization null → the openapi Shortfall example object
     with execution_shortfall_usd "3864".
  2. quiet variant — engines[0] outcome dimensions all zeroed
     (newly_eligible_accounts 0, eligible_debt_delta_usd "0",
     bad_debt_delta_usd "0"; market_realization already null).
- Mutants (each applied alone, `npm run build` + the one e2e test in isolation):
  1. bad-debt block deleted from `cellPrimaryOutcome` — killed at
     p0-fixes.spec.ts:194 `toContainText("Δ bad debt")` (cell rendered every
     other part; the bad-debt part alone went missing).
  2. `isZeroDecimal` → always false (quiet arm unreachable) — killed at
     p0-fixes.spec.ts:214 `toContainText("no effective movement")` (cell
     rendered `Δ eligible debt $0 · Δ bad debt $0` instead of the quiet line).
- Suite after revert: p0-fixes + lab + tornado e2e, matrix-outcome + lab-matrix
  unit — 190 passed.

### p0-3 health boundary price (InspectorPositionCard + evidence)
- New pins: p0-fixes.spec.ts p0-3 (2 e2e) — the row names HEALTH ("Health
  boundary price"), carries the current mark, pins the OLD copy to zero count,
  and the explain button + drawer title follow ("EXPLAIN · HEALTH BOUNDARY
  PRICE", old title zero-count).
- Step 1 grep: zero hits for `Liquidation price|LIQUIDATION PRICE|explain
  liquidation price` under web/tests — scout fact confirmed; nothing to update.
- Money reality check (the pin rule): `money()` at this callsite carries NO "$"
  prefix — the brief's placeholder pins `$4,000` / `$3,703.7` were replaced by
  the REAL renderings: current_price "400000000000" @ 8dec → `4,000`,
  lowest_healthy_price "370370370371" @ 8dec → `3,703.70370371` (traced through
  renderNullableDecimal → formatUnits(trim) → groupDecimalString). The current
  mark is pinned WITH its label (`current weETH ≈ 4,000`) because a bare
  `4,000` already matches the weETH price-input row of the same card.
- Copy: label → `Health boundary price` (null AND value arms); trailing line →
  `· current {SYM} ≈ {mark} · still healthy at exactly this price (ceil P*)`
  (the "lowest healthy" fragment folded into the sentence); ExplainButton →
  `explain health boundary price`; drawer title + drawer null-arm row label
  renamed. Diagnostic / already-breached / no-price-path chips and the drawer
  BODY rows (lowest_healthy_price wire field, ceil disclosure,
  never_liquidatable) untouched — wire-field vocabulary is provenance, not
  presentation.
- prices[0]-undefined arm: noUncheckedIndexedAccess forces a branch — the
  em-dash arm renders the sentence WITHOUT the current clause (no invented
  mark beside a dash).
- Red run (web-3818-p03red.log): both p0-3 tests failed pre-implementation,
  first at the `Health boundary price` toBeVisible — the brief's predicted red.
- Mutant (applied alone, build + run; web-3818-p03mutA/B.log): value-arm label
  reverted to `Liquidation price`.
  1. p0-3 test alone: KILLED — first-failing assertion is the rename
     toBeVisible (the mutant removes the new label before the count pin is
     reached, so the run stops there).
  2. discriminating pin in isolation (scratch spec, deleted, never committed):
     KILLED at exactly `toHaveCount(0)` — Expected 0, Received 1 — the
     presence of old copy is itself pinned against.
- Suite after revert: p0-fixes + inspector + r1-fixes e2e — 50 passed.
  typecheck: only the pre-existing lab-runbook-lines.spec.ts(858) TS2322.
