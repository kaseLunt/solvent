# UI Overhaul program ledger

Program spec: docs/specs/2026-08-09-ui-overhaul-program-design.md

## Phase 0 — trust fixes

### p0-1 address-bound stress results (LabClient)
- New pins: tests/unit/address-binding.spec.ts (6), p0-fixes.spec.ts p0-1 (2 e2e).
- Retired pins: none.
- Mutants: comparison-deletion in addressBinding — killed at lab-stale-result
  visibility (e2e) and at the stale-arm equality (unit), each in isolation.

### p0-2 outcome-aware matrix cells (matrixCells + LabMatrix)
- New pins: tests/unit/matrix-outcome.spec.ts (5), p0-fixes.spec.ts p0-2 (2 e2e).
- Updated pins: none (old→new: none). Step 1 found one sub-line pin —
  lab.spec.ts:269 `net eligible accounts +1` (plus `batch #1` at :270) — and the
  render keeps the `net eligible accounts …` fragment FIRST, so both survive
  verbatim; lab.spec.ts, tornado.spec.ts and the r9–r14 fixes specs all pass
  unchanged.
- Retired pins: none.
- Known duplication, flagged for Phase 3 cleanup: when `newly_eligible_accounts`
  ≠ 0 the sub-line states the count twice — the pinned legacy
  `net eligible accounts +N` fragment AND `cellPrimaryOutcome`'s
  `+N newly eligible` part. When Phase 3 touches the matrix, drop the legacy
  fragment and move lab.spec.ts:269's pin onto the composed part.
- Helper relocation: `usd` moved LabMatrix.tsx → matrixCells.ts (it was
  module-private to the component; the pure composition must print the same
  dollars). `find_referencing_symbols` after the move: only `cellPrimaryOutcome`
  and LabMatrix's two call sites reference it — no other consumer.
- Fixture variants (both `structuredClone` of the committed
  run-book.eth_minus_30.json, one documented purpose each):
  1. surfacing variant — engines[0].bad_debt_delta_usd → "15900";
     engines[0].market_realization null → the openapi Shortfall example object
     with execution_shortfall_usd "3864".
  2. quiet variant — engines[0] outcome dimensions all zeroed
     (newly_eligible_accounts 0, eligible_debt_delta_usd "0",
     bad_debt_delta_usd "0"; market_realization already null).
- Mutants (each applied alone, `npm run build` + the one e2e test in isolation):
  1. bad-debt block deleted from `cellPrimaryOutcome` — killed at
     p0-fixes.spec.ts:194 `toContainText("Δ bad debt")` (cell rendered every
     other part; the bad-debt part alone went missing).
  2. `isZeroDecimal` → always false (quiet arm unreachable) — killed at
     p0-fixes.spec.ts:214 `toContainText("no effective movement")` (cell
     rendered `Δ eligible debt $0 · Δ bad debt $0` instead of the quiet line).
- Suite after revert: p0-fixes + lab + tornado e2e, matrix-outcome + lab-matrix
  unit — 190 passed.
