// THE SCENARIO × ENGINE MATRIX's decision layer (Wave W-SD-A, ruling items 4
// and 6). Pure — no React, no fetch. Everything the matrix renders is decided
// here and pinned by `tests/unit/lab-matrix.spec.ts`.
//
// THE DISTINCTION THIS FILE EXISTS FOR, in the contract's own words:
//
//   "`engines` is the set of engines a scenario is DEFINED for. An engine
//    absent from it is outside the scenario's model — a property of the
//    definition, and NOT the same statement as a withheld engine, which is a
//    refusal... Collapsing the two would make an undefined cell and a censored
//    cell look alike."
//
// So NOT COVERED is derived from the committed LISTING and is knowable BEFORE
// any run happens; WITHHELD is derived from a RUN's `excluded_engines` and is
// a refusal with a code and a detail. The two never share a cell state, a
// colour, or a sentence.
//
// THE SINGLE-BATCH GUARD (the wave's context note: batches materialize ~2/min,
// so supersession is the common case, not the rare one). Results shown
// TOGETHER must come from ONE batch. Every held result is pinned to the batch
// it ran at; the cohort ANCHOR is the newest batch any held result carries;
// anything older renders as its own named state (`superseded`) with a re-run
// affordance. The matrix therefore never composes a sentence across batches —
// there is no cross-batch total anywhere in this file, and no total column at
// all.
//
// Relative imports (not the @/ alias): exercised by the unit specs under
// Playwright's transpiler as well as by Next.
